          "answer": "To get started, you'll need to <a href='https://butternutbox.com/wizard/new'>create an account</a>. This is what you will use to manage your subscription moving forward. We'll ask you some questions about your dog (or dogs) then recommend a bespoke plan for them. You can choose which of our recipes you would like to receive and we will deliver them in convenient portions direct to your door.",
          "question": "How does the subscription work?"
        },
        "question2": {
          "answer": "Butternut Box is Fresh dog food, which means it isn't excessively processed like wet or dry food. Instead, we use <b>whole, human-quality ingredients</b> you can see and say. Our meals are <b>gently cooked at 90°C</b> to lock in the nutrients, then frozen ready to serve from <b>the fridge.</b> Finally, each recipe is <b>taste-tested by us</b> to make sure it's the best it can be. Good enough for us, good enough for them.",
          "question": "How is Butternut Box made?"
        },
        "question3": {
          "answer": "We ask lots of questions about your dog when you sign up to Butternut. We're not just being nosy (although we do love talking about dogs), it's so that we make sure we are recommending the correct portion size. We'll ask about their age, weight, body condition, activity level and snacking habits. <br> <br> We then compare the information provided against our feeding guidelines. These have been created by our lead veterinary nutritionist, who is a professor in canine nutrition and a past chairperson of the Scientific Advisory Board of FEDIAF (the governing body that decides what should go into our pets’ food from a nutritional perspective).",
          "question": "How do you calculate portion sizes?"
        },
        "question4": {
          "answer": "Yes, all Butternut Box meals are complete and balanced. We actually go one step further, as they’re also <b>highly digestible</b>, which means the good stuff in our food is more easily absorbed, and dogs get more nutrients with every bite. And more nutrients on the inside means more benefits on the outside.",
          "question": "Is Butternut Box nutritionally complete?"
        },
        "question5": {
          "answer": "Every dog has different tastes, so if they're not keen on the first recipe they try, don't fret. There's plenty of others on our menu, so they're sure to find a favourite. Keep switching it up and see what takes their fancy. <br> <br> Any change in food or diet can have an effect on their tum, which is why transitioning is so important. You'll find a transitioning guide in your first box, so be sure to have a read of that before serving their first meal. It can take up to 14 days for a dog to fully transition to a new food, so stick with it, and remember we're here to help at every step of the way. Of course if your dog has any allergies or sensitivities, let us know and we'll be sure to tailor their recipes to suit them.",
          "question": "What if my dog doesn't like the food?"

        "question6": {
          "answer": "Our meals will arrive frozen, ready to be stored in your freezer or defrosted in the fridge. We put just the right amount of ice packs and insulation in your box to make sure your food stays fresh until you arrive home, then you can pop the pouches into the freezer as soon as you can. If it's thawed a little before they reach your freezer, not to worry - as long as the pouch is cold to the touch, it's perfectly safe to serve. <br> <br> A signature isn't required for delivery, so your box will be ready and waiting for you when you get home. Remember you can download our app to get updates when your box is on its way.",

          "question": "How can I cancel my subscription?"
        },
        "question8": {
          "answer": "When we say human-quality ingredients, we mean ingredients that have been sourced from the human food supply chain. In other words, ingredients like chicken, beef, carrots or peas that are of such high quality, they can be (and are) used for our own human food. Once they're inside our Kitchens, they can no longer be used for human food, but they can always be easily traced back to their origins and retain their quality from the moment they're sourced to when they're served. This is unlike the ingredients used in many kibble or wet foods, which are often difficult to trace and not fit for human consumption.",

          "text_1": "\"Bailey has been on Butternut Box since he was 12 weeks old. He's 2 years now, and has been obsessed with it ever since he was a pup. He's always looking forward to his mealtimes, and he has never once gotten bored of it. We particularly love Butternut for Bailey as it helps us manage his weight really easily. With him being a neutered Cocker Spaniel he's extremely sensitive to weight gain and so it's been really handy to know exactly how much to feed him so he stays the healthy, active Cocker he is. We've also used the free 24/7 online vet service Butternut provides which has been extremely reassuring to have in times of need.",

I have popped a few pounds on but mum says that’s due to me being middle aged (like her) my coat now is long and fluffy and I must say I am looking rather gorgeous, I really enjoy the different flavours, especially the Chicken You Out, I also received a few ‘pressies’ from my new ‘chef’ and I love Monkey, I have told my friends all about Butternut Box and now some of my pals also now have a special delivery each month... from Humphrey-thank you."

We didn’t know what breed Remus was but we loved that Butternut allowed us to tailor his food to his weight, and this could be amended as he grew. Remus absolutely loves his food, so much so we have to continually think about how to slow him down eating it; slow feeding bowls, kongs, puzzle toys - we have them all! He’s been a Butternutter for 9 months now. He has a beautiful shiny coat, he’s strong, lean and is in great shape. For us, we love how it is so convenient but there is no compromise on quality. And it is reassuring to know his food will be delivered on time to our home every 2 weeks."

We brought Marni home 2 weeks ago and tried continuing with the kibble that the breeder gave us but she wasn’t eating it. I checked the FAQ’s on Butternut Box website to see if it is suitable for puppies and it was. Marni wolfs it down and is growing nicely."

I wanted food that would excite her, that she would enjoy and that I could be sure was tailored to her breed, how active she is and her weight and size. Now she loves mealtimes. Butternut smells and looks so good I’m sure I could eat it! And it’s always just there in the fridge, I never have to worry about running out. Wren is healthy, super fit and active and I never worry about her nutrition or the amount she eats, it always disappears very quickly at mealtimes!"

He enjoys sitting under the grand piano whilst I practice each day, often chewing a doggy stick. He seems to particularly enjoy Chopin. The reason I changed his diet to Butternut was because he was losing the thickness of his coat. I was very worried about this and took him to the Vet who wanted to do all sorts of tests. I didn’t go ahead with any tests. Instead, after considerable online research into what to feed a dog, I started feeding him a Butternut diet. I began to see a slight improvement after the first two weeks and then within a month his coat was back to show ring quality again. I think his previous diet had led to poor nutrition and coat loss. Butternut has restored his coat beautifully and also he has more vitality in his general behaviour. I highly recommend Butternut and only wish I had known about it sooner."
